# Virtualhost Scripts — Licensing

Virtualhost Scripts uses a **dual-license model**: open source for the community,
commercial for enterprise use.

---

## Open Source Core — AGPLv3

Virtualhost Scripts is licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSES/AGPLv3.txt) (AGPLv3).

This covers:
- Nginx virtualhost management scripts
- Let's Encrypt certificate automation
- Documentation
**AGPLv3 in plain English:**
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- If you modify and run it as a service (SaaS), you must publish your modifications
- If you distribute it as part of a product, that product must also be AGPLv3
- Protects against cloud providers silently forking and offering as managed service

---

## Commercial License — Enterprise

A commercial license is required if you:

1. Use Virtualhost Scripts commercially with **>50 users** and **>$5M revenue/year**
2. Distribute Virtualhost Scripts inside a product **without** releasing your source under AGPLv3
3. Offer Virtualhost Scripts as a **hosted/managed service** without releasing modifications

A commercial license grants:
- Usage rights without AGPLv3 obligations
- Priority support and SLA options

See [LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt](LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt) for full terms.

## What Is Free vs. Commercial

All features are available under the AGPLv3 open source license.
A commercial license is only needed if you meet the thresholds above
and cannot comply with AGPLv3 terms.

## Why AGPLv3?

We chose AGPLv3 over MIT/Apache 2.0 deliberately:

**The SaaS loophole:** MIT and Apache 2.0 allow cloud providers to offer Virtualhost Scripts
as a managed service, fork it, add proprietary features, and never contribute back.
AGPLv3 closes this loophole — if you run it as a service, your modifications
must be open.

**We commit to the core staying open:** The core will remain AGPLv3 forever.
Enterprise features that we build on top may be commercial,
but the foundation will not be.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
This allows us to offer the commercial license while accepting community contributions.

The CLA grants us the right to:
- Include your contribution in the AGPLv3 release
- Include your contribution in commercial releases

It does NOT transfer copyright ownership. You retain copyright over your contributions.
